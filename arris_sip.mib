sipCfgPortMaxT38HSRedLevel OBJECT-TYPE
 SYNTAX Integer32(0..2)
 MAX-ACCESS read-write
 STATUS current
 DESCRIPTION
  "This MIB is used to set the maximum high-speed redundancy level that will be used for
   T.38 fax-relay in both the send and receive direction.  High speed redundancy refers
   to the number of additional older data packets included in each T.38 datagram when
   transferring fax data between endpoints.  For example, if an endpoint is transmitting
   T.38 with a high-speed redundancy level of two and the current sequence number of the
   data packet is 15, two older (i.e. previously transmitted) data packets with sequence
   numbers 13 and 14 are included in the T.38 datagram.  In general, this makes T.38
   data transmission much less susceptible to packet loss in the network.  This parameter
   is configuration to restrict the amount of bandwidth used for T.38 transmission.

   Setting the maximum high-speed redundancy level does not necessarily mean that the
   endpoint will always transmit and receive at that level.  The endpoint will attempt to
   transmit at that level only if allowed by the remote endpoint.  During call setup the
   remote endpoint may provide the T38FaxMaxDatagram attribute within its SDP indicating
   the maximum datagram size that it is able to receive.  If this number is smaller than
   is needed to transmit at the maximum level, the redundancy will be reduced accordingly.

   Likewise, the local endpoint will construct its T38FaxMaxDatagram attribute according
   to the maximum high-speed redundancy level configured to restrict the far end from
   sending T.38 datagram packets with a higher level of high-speed redundancy.  This does
   not necessarily mean that the remote endpoint will transmit at the maximum high-speed
   redundancy configured, but does guarantee that it will not transmit at a higher level.
   The remote endpoint may be configured to transmit at a lower high-speed redundancy level,
   or may choose to reduce the transmission speed to reduce the bandwidth consumption."

 DESCRIPTION
  "An NVM setting has been added that stores the state of Call Waiting Permanent Disabled so that the state
   survives a reset.  This MIB enables the storage of the Call Waiting state in NVM.  Some customers will want
   to leave this MIB at a default value of 0 because of the following scenario:
   1.   MSO issues a modem to end user A
   2.   A dials star code to disable call waiting
   3.   MSO reclaims modem
   4.   MSO issues the modem to end user B
   5.   B does not know why call waiting does not work.

   Values:
      1 - Call Waiting Permanent Disable state is NOT stored in NVM, and Call Waiting returns to MSO defined default settings
          when a reset occurs. If neither sipCfgCallWaitingCapability nor sipCfgPortFeatureSettings is defined in the MTA
          configuration file, then Call Waiting will be enabled at reset.
      2 - If the end user dials a dial code to disable call waiting, that setting will survive resets and will last until one
          of the following events occurs: end user dials a dial code to enable call waiting,  or sipCfgResetCallWaitingStarCode MIB is
          used via SNMP.

   This MIB can only be set via the MTA configuration file."

 DESCRIPTION
  "This MIB is intended for use by the MSO to enable call waiting via SNMP if they have sipCfgCallWaitingDisableSurvivesReset
   set to 1 and the following happens:
   1.   MSO issues a modem to end user A
   2.   A dials star code to disable call waiting
   3.   MSO reclaims modem
   4.   MSO issues the modem to end user B
   5.   B does not know why call waiting does not work.

   This MIB can be used to clear the NVM setting for call waiting disable since a reset will not clear it if the MTA
   configuration file specifies a sipCfgCallWaitingDisableSurvivesReset of 1.

   Usage:
      Hexadecimal bit string where each bit represents a different phone line (starting with line 1 on the least significant
      bit).  The bit string specifies for which lines to reset the NVM Call Waiting setting to its default value of enabled.
      If a bit is set to 1, that line's NVM Call Waiting setting is returned to default.  If a bit is set to 0, nothing is
      done to that line.

   EXAMPLE:
      To return call waiting to factory default setting for all lines, set sipCfgResetCallWaitingStarCode to FFFFFFFF.
      To reset the setting for line  1 only, set sipCfgResetCallWaitingStarCode to 00000001.
      To reset the setting for line 12 only, set sipCfgResetCallWaitingStarCode to 00000800.

      When reclaiming a modem from one end user and issuing it to another, if sipCfgCallWaitingDisableStarCodeSurvivesReset
      was set to true in the config file, then it is advisable to set sipCfgResetCallWaitingStarCode to FFFFFFFF via SNMP
      before giving the modem to the new user."

  DESCRIPTION
    "This object is like sipCfgSipFeatureSwitch. It is used to enable features of
     the Arris SIP MTA. From left to right, the specified bit indicates whether
     or not the corresponding feature is enabled/disabled.  For example, if the
     first bit is set, then the pwdAutoGen feature is enabled. If it is zero,
     the feature is disabled.  NO bits are set by default.

     /** BIT Descriptions **/
     0x80000000 : pwdAutoGen       - Auto-generate the SIP password.
     0x40000000 : sipFailover      - EDVA will failover to the secondary PCSCF when detect msg failure.
     0x20000000 : commonNonce      - Cache latest nonce for all outgoing messages.
     0x08000000 : noRegOffhook     - Don't try to register if user goes offhook when initial registration is not completed.
     0x04000000 : perLineImpi      - SIP password auto-generation generates per-line IMPIs.
     0x02000000 : dnsCache         - Use cached DNS records when receive negative response or no response.
     0x01000000 : optDstTimezone   - The timezone part of MIB pktcEUERSTCIDDisDSTInfo (PC20) or sipCfgCIDDisDSTInfo (Legacy SIP) is optional, CM learned timezone will be used if timezone not provided.
     0x00800000 : rejectInviteWith480 - If the line is disconnected from a call but remains off-hook, it rejects the incoming INVITE with 480 instead of 486.
     0x00400000 : perLineProxySelection - Each line contacts proxies with its own order.

     0x00001000 : addPAccessNetworkInfoHeaderCancel - If flag(0x00002000) of sip_ftr2 is enabled, P-Access-Network-Info header will be added to CANCEL and ACK related outgoing SIP message.
     0x00000800 : regUponNetworkRecovery - Try immediate registration once network is recovered.
     0x00000400 : deregisterLineEnable - if CM/MTA reset is determined, the EMTA will try to de-register each registerred line.

     0x00000100 : sessionTimerNegotiationEnable - When it is enabled, the EMTA will not place 'refresher=uac' to the Session-Expires header of outgoing initial INVITE, and let the called party decide the refresher.

     0x00000010 : inviteErrorHandlingEnhancement - enable invite error handling enhancement for 413 according to RFC3261 , an INVITE without SDP will be re-sent with the same CALLID as the former INVITE
     0x00000008 : useDomainNameInRouteHeader - With this bit set, domain name is used in route header of outgoing registration message when PCSCF type is DNS.
     0x00000004 : unsubMwiDuringFailover - With this bit set, if flag(0x40000000) of sip_ftr2 is enabled, EMTA will unsubscribe MWI when failover or failback is successful.

      DESCRIPTION "The value of this MIB overrides the eUE IP addressing mode preference specified via the eCM DHCP exchange.
      If this MIB is set to any value other than 0(dhcp), the eUE will choose its preference based on the MIB setting
      as opposed to any preference that is specified by the DHCP exchange.
      The values are as follows:
         dhcp(0) - No override, eUE uses preference per eCM DHCP exchange
         ipv4(1) - eUE operates in single-stack IPv4 addressing mode
         ipv6(2) - eUE operates in single-stack IPv6 addressing mode
         ipv4SecIpv6(3) - eUE acquires IPv4 primary address, IPv6 secondary address
         ipv6SecIpv4(4) - eUE acquires IPv6 primary address, IPv4 secondary address
         ipv6BypassDssid(5) - eUE operates in single-stack IPv6 addressing mode, bypass the DSS_ID check
      Default is dhcp, except for CT loads, where option is ipv4."
